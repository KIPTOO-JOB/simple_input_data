# Car Speed and Demerit Points Program

This JavaScript program takes the speed of a car as input and provides feedback based on the speed. If the speed is less than 70 km/h, it prints "Ok". For every 5 km/h above the speed limit (70 km/h), it gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points. If the driver accumulates more than 12 demerit points, the program prints "License suspended".

## Functionality

The program includes a single function that handles the input, calculation, and output of speed and demerit points:

- **checkSpeed**: This function prompts the user to enter the speed of the car, checks the speed against the speed limit, calculates demerit points if necessary, and outputs the appropriate message.
